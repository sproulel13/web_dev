	Although I will be presented with many challenges during the course of this program, one of the more challenging things I have found in my own coding practice has been maintaining patience. I find that when a problem takes too long to solve, I doubt my solution entirely and become afraid of doing things incorrectly. To correct this way of thinking and develop more patience, I will try to reassure myself that these struggles are a part of the learning process, as well as seeking others out to look at my problem with fresh eyes. Remaining persistant will also be an important part of overcoming this challenge, and with some assistance, I hope to do just that.
